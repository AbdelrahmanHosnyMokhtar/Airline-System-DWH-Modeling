# Airline-System-DWH-Modeling
A leading airline company engaged our services to support the executive management in their analysis of current business processes and identification of new opportunities for company growth.

 Project Descreption:
- Executives decided that the first deliverable should focus on the flight activity in order to ensure a good ongoing business process.
- The marketing department wants to analyze what flights the companyâ€™s frequent flyers take, what fare basis they pay, how often they upgrade, how they earn and redeem their frequent flyer miles, whether they respond to special fare promotions, how long their overnight stays are, and what proportion of these frequent flyers have gold, platinum or titanium status.
- Your analysis shall also include the reservation process where the finance team will be interested in analyzing the company's profit. Note that reservation processes can take place through multiple channels. The airline company also provides customer care interaction before, within, and after your trip in order to handle customer inquiries, and complaints and keep their feedback for business enhancements. Analysis should include interaction type and problem severity (if an issue exists) State the processes for your company then apply your modeling technique/s with a demonstrative layering methodology to design the logical and physical design to support such kind of analysis for decision support.

ðŸ–¥ Project Requirements

    State the modeling process for each business process.
    Construct a logical data model for this Project using any diagramming tool you like. The output should be an image or PDF. State why did you choose this particular     data model design? What does the data represent? (Details about each model component are necessary).
    Translate the logical data model to a physical data model which includes the following: tables, columns (name, data type), primary indexes, and foreign indexes,        and state why these types of indexes are used for each column. The output should be an Excel file.
    Create a table/s in oracle DBMS and populate sample data for your queries.
    Construct a sample of SQL queries (5 â€“ 8 queries) using your physical model design which can be used to answer possible questions by the decision maker as             described in the Project above. List the business question with each query. The output should be a Word file.

## What We have done in this Project: 
- We started by thinking of how many business process we need to implement this and get those reports to different sectors in the company, After too many disscutions we decided that we have to put 3 process to ask all the questions. 
- 1) The Behavior of the passangers which includes all about the ticket, the passanger, the flight, it's route, and if there is any promotions on it to report for the marketing and finance team. 
- 2) Customer Care fact to get the customers feedbacks and know thier opinoins to improve our services. 
- 3) The Flight to report to the exectuive all about the business and how it's going. 
- After finished putting the processes we managed to define the Dimensions that will help us describe different things in the business. 
- Going to building the different models like the logical model,the dimensional model, the pysical model, and also the bus matrix.  
- After finishing all of that and all the relations we start to create the model on the DBMS then putting some dummy data and make 5 SQL queries to tell some informations about the data.
